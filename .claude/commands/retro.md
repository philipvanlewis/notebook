# Session Retrospective

Capture learnings and improvements from this development session.

## Steps

1. Ask me about the session:
   - What went well?
   - What was challenging?
   - What did you learn?
   - What would you do differently?

2. Read @docs/project-status.md to understand context

3. Document learnings:
   - If there are gotchas or lessons learned, add them to a GOTCHAS.md file (create if doesn't exist)
   - If there are process improvements, note them in project-status.md

4. Update @docs/project-status.md with:
   - Session summary in "Recent Activity"
   - Any new blockers or risks identified
   - Notes for next session

5. Summarize the retrospective and suggest next actions
