# Update Project Status

Update @docs/project-status.md at the end of a development session.

## Steps

1. Ask me:
   - What did we accomplish this session?
   - What were we last working on?
   - What should be the next step?
   - Are there any blockers?

2. Read current @docs/project-status.md

3. Update the following sections:
   - **Last updated**: Set to today's date
   - **Recent Accomplishments > Last Session**: Move previous to "Earlier" if exists, add today's accomplishments
   - **Where We Left Off**: Update with what we were working on
   - **Milestone Progress**: Check off completed items, add any new items
   - **Blockers**: Update if any
   - **Notes for Next Session**: Add any important context

4. Save the file

5. Optionally commit with message: "docs: Update project status"
