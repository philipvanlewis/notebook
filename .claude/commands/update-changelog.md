# Update Changelog

Add an entry to @docs/changelog.md for recent changes.

## Steps

1. Ask me:
   - Is this for a release or just updating the Unreleased section?
   - If release: What version number? (following semver)
   - What are the main changes to document?

2. Read current @docs/changelog.md

3. If updating Unreleased:
   - Add entries under appropriate category (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)

4. If creating a release:
   - Move Unreleased items to new version section
   - Add version number and today's date
   - Create new empty Unreleased section

5. Save the file

6. Show the updated changelog section
